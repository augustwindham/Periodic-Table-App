# Periodic-Table-App
This app will calculate the molar mass of any combination of entered elements. It is built in a way that allows for the easy addition of new features suck as a formula balancer which I am currently working on.

The file titled PT_db.py is the code I wrote to download the data. I saved the results in a file called PTdata.csv which is also attached so that the user can have a quicker download.

If the data is saved in the working directory then the molarmass script will work.

Dependencies:
  I used the following packages
  import weakref
  from tkinter import *
  from tkinter.ttk import *
  from tkinter import messagebox
